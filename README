# Summary

I really liked Diomedia_be’s work, but needed 1U outer column, (needs latest boards, mine is from https://shop.profetkeyboards.com/product/ergodox-pcbs).
I also reworked overall look for my own pleasure.

You’ll find everything you need to print and tweak in the `files` folder.

Uses M3 bolt (15mm) and nuts on the underside.
